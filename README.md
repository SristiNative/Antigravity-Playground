### AI-Native Builder • Privacy & Security by Design

---

## ❓ Why this GitHub exists
Most software today is built for speed first, with **security and privacy added later**—often as patches, policies, or workarounds.

This GitHub exists to **challenge that default**.

I use it as a place to **design and build AI-native tools** that solve **real business and real-world problems**, while treating **privacy and security as design constraints from the start**, not afterthoughts.

---

## 🔍 What I focus on
- Turning complex requirements into **simple, usable systems**
- Building AI-powered tools that **reduce friction without weakening controls**
- Exploring how **agentic and no-code platforms** can still support secure-by-default design

---

## 🛠️ How I build
- **AI / Models:** GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini  
- **Agentic Development:** Antigravity, LangFlow, BuildShip  
- **Web:** Next.js, React  
- **Cloud:** Vercel (Serverless & Edge)  
- **Principles:** Privacy by Design • Security by Default • Least Privilege  

---

## 🚀 Active Projects
- **ai-security-lab**  
  Practical experiments around security misconfigurations, policy reasoning, and AI-assisted analysis

- **antigravity-playground**  
  Rapid prototyping with agent-driven development, tested against real constraints

> Projects evolve through iteration, testing, and failure.

## 🧭 Current Intent
- Build tools that are **useful before they are impressive**
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Learn by shipping, measuring, and improving
